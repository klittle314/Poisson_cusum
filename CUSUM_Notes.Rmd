## Introduction to CUSUM control chart based on Poisson counts
The Shewhart control chart based on Poisson counts is the c-chart. The center line $\overline{c}$ is the average of the observed event counts; the upper control limit is $\overline{c} + 3\sqrt\overline{c}$.

The c-chart is an all-purpose tool that can detect a range of special (assignable) causes. A CUSUM chart for Poisson counts is designed to detect one kind of special cause: relatively small shifts in mean level. Relative to the c-chart, a CUSUM chart will identify small shifts in the Poisson mean more quickly.  The increased sensitivity comes at a cost of greater complexity in design and interpretation. 

Lucas in "Counted Data CUSUM's", *Technometrics*, **27**(2), 129-144 outlined the motivation and computations for cumulative sum control charts for count data. He described charts for Poisson counts and for time betweeen Poisson events.

Lucas applied the CUSUM technique to a ten-year series of industrial accidents recorded monthly.  His summary comment applies to our work in monitoring and responding to series related to Covid-19:

"...on a purely statistical basis, small changes in accident rates cannot be detected quickly...Accidents are noncomformances in a safety system where, as [sic] defects are nonconformances in a quality system.  Similar management approaches will work for both safety and quality.  Once the count rate is low, every count signals a need for follow-up.  The follow-up effort will increase consciousness and remove assignable causes so that continued improvement can be made.  Although each small improvement (in safety or quality) may be practically undetectable (i.e. not statistically signficant), the cumulative effect of many small improvements will give a continually improving system."

### Using simulation to determine the key parameters of a Poisson counts CUSUM chart
If we believe that a sequence of independent Poisson events is a reasonable approximation to events generated by some system, we need  three unique parameters to determine the structure of a CUSUM chart.

The first two parameters are Poisson means: $\mu_{1}$ is the mean of the Poisson variable during a baseline period and $\mu_{2}$ the mean of the Poisson variable in a subsequent period. Remember that the CUSUM chart is designed to quickly detect the shift from $\mu_{1}$ to $\mu_{2}$.

The reference value $k$ is a function of the means.  The formula is derived from the Sequential Probability Ratio Test to compare two Poisson means:
$$k = (\mu_{2} - \mu_{1})/ln(\mu_{2}/\mu_{1})$$.
If $Y_{i}$ is the i-th variable in a Poisson series, the CUSUM statistic is defined as a recursion:
$$S_{i} = max(0,Y_{i} - k + S_{i-1})$$.
Lucas presents options for the starting value $S_{0}$.  We will use $S_{0} = 0$.

Lucas shows a series of tables that enable a user to choose a chart design, based on the Average Run Length.  The aim: choose a design with long ARL for mean level $\mu_{1}$ and short ARL for mean level $\mu_{2}$.

Computing the ARL requires a third parameter, $h$. $h$ determines the run length i for a specific sequence; the run length is defined as the first index value i such that $S_{i} \ge h$. 

In the simulations below, we use $\mu_{1} = 1$ and $\mu_{2} = 2$.  These choices determine $k = 1.443$, approximately.
### Reproducing Table 1 Entries in Lucas (1985)
Lucas generated estimates of average run length using a Markov chain method (Brook, D., and Evans, D. A. (1972), “An Approach to the Probability Distribution of CUSUM Run Lengths,” *Biometrika*,
**59**, 539-549).  For integer values of k, this method can give exact results.

We can estimate average run lengths by simulating nrep repetitions of a Poisson sequence of length n, calculating the CUSUM statistic for different k values and comparing to the entries in Lucas's Table 1.  We explored simulation for three reasons:  (1) to understand the structure of the CUSUM chart; (2) to estimate ARL values for non-integer values of k; (3) to provide a test case for more general distributional assumptions than Poisson events.

Over the range of values studied, the ARLs typically agreed to two significant digits for the shifted mean.  It takes a several minutes to generate the ARLs for the null case; as h increases, I needed to increase the length of the Poisson series to find at least one CUSUM statistic to equal or exceed $h$.  Agreement between simulated values and tabled values for the null case was not as good as for shifted case.   The simulation gives a sense of the variation in the run length distributions.

For illustration, consider the value $k = 1$ and the $h\in (2,3,5,7,10)$. 

Compare the Means in the tables below to entries in Lucas's Table 1:  rows with the five h values, k = 1.0, and columns labeled 1.0 and 2.0
